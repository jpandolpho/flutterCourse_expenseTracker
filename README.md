# Expense Tracker

This Flutter project was made following the course "Flutter & Dart - The Complete Guide [2025 Edition]", available [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/).

## Description

In this section of the course, we make an expenses tracking app as a way to learn how to accept more complex inputs from the user (that aren't just button clicks), how to use modals and dialogs and how to do an app-wide theming (such as changing to night mode, following the devices own configuration).
